# Django_Ecommerce
An ecommerce website built using django framework and it has the ability to let users add items to cart, proceed to checkout and shop both as registered users and guests.
##### Technologies
No frameworks or RESST-API was used for the front-end.
For Add to cart functionality and site cookis, I used Javascript.
